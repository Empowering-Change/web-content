**We support great ideas that make a difference.** We're looking for solutions to social problems big and small, focusing on equity, open access to information, and social justice.

**Anyone can apply.** Individuals, groups, small organizations, or big ones – it doesn't matter. We care about real outcomes that improve human lives, not paperwork and administrivia.

**Tell us:**

* What's the problem you want to solve?
    
* How will your idea fix it?
    
* How will we know if it works?
    
* How much will it cost?
    

**We believe in you!** We'll provide small grants to get your idea off the ground. If it works, we might even give you more to make it bigger.

**Simple application, big ideas.** No fancy language, just tell us in plain words why your idea is awesome. Keep it short and sweet.
