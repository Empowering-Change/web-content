***"When new technology becomes widely available, lawyers can't help but ask: How will this affect my practice? Or, more accurately: Are the robots going to take my job?"*** *(*[*Evaluating The Legal Ethics Of A ChatGPT-Authored Motion*](https://plus.lexis.com/api/permalink/aecf687d-7b05-4c57-b451-d77172bd832a/?context=1530671)*)*

How audacious! And yet how charmingly na√Øve for a highly trained legal professional to doubt their own intelligence is worth more. Perhaps it's not, perhaps they did enter law school lured by the promise of a big paycheck in exchange for billing every six minutes for the rest of their working lives.

A reminder to those who went to law school for the check that you have no job without a client. Your existence relies at least superficially on your ability to remove your own selfish interests and faithfully represent your client's interests. And yet that quote: it's rich with the irony of reality!

## 1\. Introduction to the impact of AI on the legal profession

Knowledge-based professions are evolving, driven by the rapid advancement of augmented intelligence (AI). The domain-specific, esoteric, and sometimes byzantine practice of law is no exception. While language-based generative AI will aid lawyers and their clients, some who thrive in ignorance are express concern about doom from imagined disruptions and job displacements that may arise. A parade of horribles indeed! The irony lies in the legal profession's traditional nature, which often resists change, yet it must adapt to AI to remain relevant.

### 1.1 The irony of the legal profession's traditional nature vs. the need to adapt to AI

The legal profession has historically been slow to adopt new technologies, preferring to rely on established practices and procedures. However, the rise of AI demands a shift in this mindset, as lawyers must now navigate the complexities of AI-driven tools and platforms to remain competitive.

### 1.2 The risk of becoming obsolete if the profession doesn't adapt

Failure to adapt to AI may result in lawyers becoming obsolete, as they struggle to keep pace with the rapid changes in the legal landscape. The IMF has warned that 40% of all jobs in the world could be affected by AI, with white-collar and professional roles being particularly vulnerable. The legal profession is not immune to this threat, and lawyers must take proactive steps to upskill and reskill to remain relevant.

## 2\. The democratization of language and knowledge

The advent of AI has led to a significant shift in the way we access and interact with information. This democratization of language and knowledge has far-reaching implications for the legal profession.

### 2.1 The increasing accessibility of information and knowledge

With the rise of AI-powered search engines and online resources, legal information is now more accessible than ever before. This increased accessibility has the potential to level the playing field, allowing non-traditional players to enter the legal profession and providing lawyers with a wealth of information at their fingertips.

### 2.2 The potential for non-traditional players to enter the legal profession

The democratization of language and knowledge has created opportunities for non-traditional players to enter the legal profession. AI-powered legal tools and platforms are enabling non-lawyers to provide legal services, potentially disrupting the traditional legal landscape.

### 2.3 The need for lawyers to adapt and develop new skills

As the legal profession becomes more accessible, lawyers must adapt and develop new skills to remain competitive. This includes learning to work with AI-powered tools, developing skills in data analysis and interpretation, and focusing on high-value tasks that require human judgment and empathy.
